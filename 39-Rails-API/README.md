# Rails API
- Dynamic web pages with JS front end and Rails backend
- Single page application

### Why?
- Response with request for data with data (json)
- Manage large database (update/add rows)
- Use relationship between models

### Getting Started
`rails new --api <project_name>`

### Useful Rails Commands
- `rails g model cat`
- `rake db:migrate rake db:seed`
- `rails g controller cats`

### CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

### Serializers
- Have our cat data, and nest hobby data inside cat

##### Custom Serializers

##### Using a gem
- `rails g serializer cat`

### CRUD
 - We can Read
 - Let's now Create
 - How would we do Update or Delete?

### Improvements
- Validations
- Remove all relationships with delete resource
