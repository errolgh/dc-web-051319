### Goals for Module 3
- Learn how to learn a new programming languages
- Learn how to problem solve, break things down, and work incrementally (debugging)
- Learn how to be resourceful

### JavaScript History
- Created by Brendan Eich in 1995
- Wanted to turn the web into something like a desktop application (SPA)
- Not related to JAVA (JS was first code named Mocha, then LiveScript)
- So vast...

### Intro to Javascript

### Difference between Ruby and JS
- JS is more syntactically strict
- JS is sometimes less strict
- Type coercion
- many many ways to define variables (scope)
- Everything is an object

### Datatypes
Primitive
- numbers
- strings
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- symbols

Objects
- objects
- arrays
- functions



### Functions as Objects
var myObj = {key1: [1, 2, function(){return function(){return function(){return 8}}}]}

### Pass by Value versus Pass by Reference





### Announcements
- FSP!
- More labs are being deployed right now for JavaScript Events! Work on them
